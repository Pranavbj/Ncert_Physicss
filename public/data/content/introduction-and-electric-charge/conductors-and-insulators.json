Other things, like plastic, wood, or glass, don't let electrons move easily. We call them insulators."

But if you use a metal spoon, it doesn't get charged because the electrons can flow away through your body.\nNow, if you rub a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle, it might get charged because the electrons can't escape through the non-metal part.\nSo, conductors let electrons move, while insulators keep them in place."
