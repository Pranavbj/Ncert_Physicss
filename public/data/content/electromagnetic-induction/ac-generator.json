      "body": "As discussed earlier, one way to generate an electric current in a loop is by changing its orientation or effective area. When a coil spins in a magnetic field $B$, the effective area of the loop becomes $A \\cos \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $A$ and $B$. This concept is fundamental to the operation of a basic AC generator, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy."

This coil, the armature, rotates in a uniform magnetic field, inducing an electric current. The ends of the coil connect to an external circuit using slip rings and brushes"
